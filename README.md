Kingfish
==

python routines for the KINGFISH project.  Be sure to download/install the sedpy repository

Todo:

high priority:
     bolometric correction method needs to be written. 
     conversion between mag/arcsec^2 and Lbol/kpc in 'set_basic_info' (with default for BC, or in load_stellar populations). 
     methods for weighted average profiles (in utils). 
     convolution of profiles with psf. 

less pressing:
     settle on way to deal with deprojected pixel radii (compute on the fly or generate an image?). 
     plotting code. 
     code to parse the aniano results file. 
     code to parse the magphys output. 
     code to make tables.
