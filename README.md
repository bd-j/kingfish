pyKingfish
==

python routines for the KINGFISH project.

Todo:

high priority:
     code for convolved image names in read_image
     bolometric correction method needs to be written
     conversion between mag/arcsec^2 and Lbol/kpc in 'set_basic_info' (with default for BC, or in load_stellar populations)
     methods for weighted average profiles (in utils)
     convolution of profiles with psf

less pressing:
     settle on way to deal with deprojected pixel radii (compute on the fly or generate an image?)
     plotting code
     code to parse the aniano results file
     code to parse the magphys output
     code to make tables
